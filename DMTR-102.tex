\section{Introduction}
\label{sect:intro}


\subsection{Objectives}
\label{sect:objectives}

Testing for the raw image from the DAQ to being written to the archive
service at the LDF\\
This test activity demonstrates the successful execution of the major
components of the storing of raw image files from the DAQ to the DBB and
then visualized through the LSST science platform (LSP). ~ This is at a
very small scale and it to test the components of a proof of concept
that they all work together. ~\\[2\baselineskip]It will demonstrate

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Data can be transferred into the lsst data facility (LDF). ~~
\item
  The raw data images can be ingested by the DBB along with some
  metadata about the image and providence. ~
\item
  The data files ~can then be retrieved by the LSP
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Scope}\label{scope}

The overall test plan for the LSST Data Management system is described
in \citeds{LDM-503}.\\
This document specifically refers to the milestone LDM-503-8b, which
tests the raw image archiving for a CCOB device. ~



\subsection{System Overview}
\label{sect:systemoverview}

The raw image archiving system that is part of the LSST Data Management
system is responsible for the data being stored into the archive
environment at the LDF from various sources. ~It will depend on what DAQ
system (spectragraph, comcam, lsstcam, CCOB\ldots{} others) as to where
the data is located originally, and then how it will be sent to NCSA
(LDF) . ~ ~The tests begin with data somewhere that needs to be stored
at the archive enviornment at LDF and ingested into the DBB. ~ The
LDM-503-5 milestone is limited to the raw image archive from a CCOB
device, not all types of devices and is limited in scope.

  \subsection{Test Cycle LVV-C8 }

Open test cycle {\it \href{https://jira.lsstcorp.org/secure/Tests.jspa#/testrun/LVV-C8}{503-8b raw image archiving for CCOB cycle}} in Jira.

  503-8b raw image archiving for CCOB cycle\\
  Status: Not Executed

  Test cycle for the raw image archiving of data from a CCOB device. ~This
data needs to be stored at the LDF and ingested so that it can be looked
at by scientists. ~ The data needs to be transferred to the LDF and then
ingested into the archive service so that it can be retrieved through a
butler to be displayed for further use. ~ This should be tested with a
human involved at first for moving the data and making sure all the
pieces work. ~ It should also be tested for when things are working more
as a service, and without a human involved for an automatic data archive
process. ~


  \subsubsection{Software Version/Baseline}
    The DBB version is 1.0, and can be found in the github repository when
it has been fully developed. ~ The current DBB is a script for scraping
data from the header file and getting the file name and the metadata
required along with providence. ~ At the time of this writing, the DBB
use cases and requirements are just being written. ~ ~The database
component is Oracle and the ingest file systems and output file systems
for DBB are in GPFS at the LDF.~~


  \subsubsection{Configuration}
    The configuration for this test is the data is located in a file system
somewhere. ~It is transferred to NCSA into a the LSST GPFS file system.
~ Files that are needed in the DBB are moved to the DBB ingest file
system. ~ the data backbone gathers the info from the headers and file
name. ~it inserts rows into the DBB consolidated DB environment and
moves the file to the DBB file systems that are used by the LSP to once
again find the raw image file to be viewed/displayed for further
analysis. ~

  further analysis;
\end{itemize}


    {\bf Preconditions}:\\
    None.


    Execution status: {\bf Not Executed }

    Final comment:\\Need to have the CCOB raw data files pinpointed to be the ones that is
